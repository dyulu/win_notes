###### How to dual-boot Windows 11 and Linux on your PC
Prepare to dual-boot Linux:
    Modern Windows computers come with a feature called Secure Boot
    Secure Boot can cause issues with a lot of Linux distributions that don't support this feature

    To disable Secure Boot:

    Right-click primary partition (it should be the one labeled as C:) and choose Shrink Volume...
    Specify the amount of space to remove from the partition

    Leave it as is and close the window

###### How to disable Windows 10 fast startup

Windows PCs typically operate in a number of Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) power states

An S0 power state is when your PC is running and ready to respond to your input

There are a number of sleep states, including S1, S2, and S3

There is also a hybrid sleep state where hibernation is used in tandem with a sleep state

Hibernation is considered an S4 power state

While hibernating, PC will seem like it is completely off, but there will be a saved hibernation file ready to be used to boot
    back to where it was during last user session

An S5 power state (soft off) is when your PC is shut down and rebooted completely
    There's no hibernation file and no saved user session

There is also a G3 power state, which is when your PC consumes absolutely no power and is completely turned off

With fast startup enabled, choosing to shut down PC might look like completely shutting things down, but in reality, the PC is
    entering a mix between a shutdown and hibernation

Disable fast startup:
    Right-click the Start button
    Search for Control Panel
    Click Power Options
    Click Choose what the power buttons do
    Click Change settings that are currently unavailable
    Click Turn on fast startup (recommended) so that the checkmark disappears
    Click Save changes
